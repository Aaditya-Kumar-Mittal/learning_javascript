## File Structure

```code
.
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
```

- **index.html**: Contains the basic structure and layout of the webpage.
- **style.css**: Provides styling for the webpage elements.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript logic for generating the random paragraph.

## Code Explanation

### HTML (`index.html`)

- The `input` element with the id `numberOfWords` allows the user to enter the number of words they want in the generated paragraph.
- The `button` element triggers the `generatePara()` function, which generates the random paragraph and displays it.

### JavaScript (`script.js`)

- The `generateWords` function generates a random string of letters.
- The `generatePara` function creates a new paragraph element (`<p>`) and fills it with randomly generated words based on the number entered by the user.
- The generated paragraph is then appended to the container in the HTML document.

### CSS (`style.css`)

- Basic styling to ensure that the input field, button, and generated paragraph are presented clearly on the page.

## Future Improvements

- Add functionality to allow the user to generate multiple paragraphs.
- Enhance the randomness and structure of the generated words to make them more realistic.
- Improve the styling and responsiveness of the webpage.
